## Game Controls

Arrow Keys - Move
Q - Basic Attacks
Hold Q - Charge Attack
E - Special Attack
Tab - Change Class

## Game Ideas

**Swordsman** (first player state)
- make it so that space can interrupt attack
- q 3 times spam attack
- hold q charge attack - make it so that move state can override
- if q is spammed, then skip over idle? slow q spam

**General**
- add background and tilemap
- swag it out bro
